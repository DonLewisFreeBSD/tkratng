   TkRat software and its included text is Copyright 1996-2002 by
   Martin Forssén.

   The full text of the legal notices is contained in the file called
   COPYRIGHT, included with this distribution.



	PORTABILITY

This software should work on any Unix-system where you can build tcl/tk.


	BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

TkRat depends on tcl/tk 8.2 or later so these must be installed. Tcl/tk
8.3.4 is recommended.

	run './configure'

This will configure the makefiles etc. See INSTALL for options to configure.
Configure depends on you having tclsh8.2 and wish8.2 or later in your path.
If configure fails to locate the tcl/tk include-files you might have to
help it by providing a --with-tcl-include=DIR argument.

	do a 'make'

This should build the software.
Ignore any errors you get about not being able to build mtest.

You might want to test the software before installing it. Change directory
to either the lib/ or tkrat/ directories ('cd tkrat') and run
'../tkrat/tkrat'. If everything seems to work you can install it.

	do a 'make install'

This will install the program in /usr/local/bin. The destination can
be overridden with the --prefix argument to configure in the first step.

The makefiles will install one small tcl-program in /usr/local/bin, some
dynamically loadable modules in /usr/local/lib/tkrat2.1 and a set of
tcl files in /usr/local/share/tkrat2.1. The paths to those two later
directories are written into the small tkrat program in /usr/local/bin.
A small manpage is also installed into /usr/local/man/man1.

You can change the name of the program and the directory for the library
files by using the --program-prefix and --program-suffix arguments to
configure.


	SSL

TkRat will now include ssl-support if the openssl library is found by
configure. One can help configure on the way by using the
--with-ssl-dir argument. To be able to verify server certificates you
must have the relevant CA-certificates installed on your
system. Exactly where those should be stored depends upon your ssl-
configuration. But usually they should be found in
$OPENSSLDIR/cert.pem


	CONFIGURATION

You can have site-wide configuration files. Configuration issues
are covered in the CONFIGURATION file.


	PERMISSIONS of /var/spool/mail

TkRat expects /var/spool/mail to have permissions drwxrwxrwt. That is
everybody has write access but the sticky bit is on. It is NOT safe
to make TkRat setgid or setuid.


	DELIVERY STATUS NOTIFICATIONS (DSN)

TkRat supports DSN as defined in rfc1891-4. This requires that messages are
sent via ESMTP and that the MTA (mail transfer agent) also supports DSN
(otherwise you will not get DSN support, TkRat will still work though).
Actually all MTA's the message will pass through must talk DSN for it to
work fully (otherwise you will just get DSN's with the action field set to
forwarded).


	CURRENT INFORMATION

This software has a webpage at http://www.tkrat.org/
This page should always contain up to date information abut tkrat.
There is also a mailing list on which announcements of new versions are
posted. To subscribe send a mail to tkrat-announce-request@tkrat.org,
or visit the list page at http://www.tkrat.org/mailman/listinfo/tkrat-announce
There is also a discussion list which you can subscribe to at
tkrat-request@tkrat.org or http://www.tkrat.org/mailman/listinfo/tkrat
(announcements are posted to both lists). To send messages to this list
send them to tkrat@tkrat.org


	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank all those people who has helped me test TkRat.
I would also like to thank Tristan Tarrant who did the Italian version of
all the texts, thanks also goes to Christope Martin, Stéphane Gourmelen,
Noël Giraud, and Éric Simon for the french texts. As well as to Srdjan
Pokorni for the Serbian translation.


	POSTCARDS

TkRat is free to use, I do not require anything from any of its users. But
I do not mind getting postcards. In fact I think it is a great way to keep
track of how far it has spread. So if you like TkRat (and if you want to) you
can send me a postcard from where you live. I have the following address:

	BUGS (aka UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES)

Please report any found bugs to maf@dtek.chalmers.se


	AUTHOR's ADDRESS

The author (thats me) can be reached at maf@tkrat.org
I live in south of the city of Göteborg in Sweden.


	MISC NOTES

I have had reports that the tcl/tk included in Solaris 8 have some
serious problems which leads to the usage of excessive amounts of
CPU. I recommend upgrading to 8.3.4 or later.
