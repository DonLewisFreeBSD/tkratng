Some random notes on how to develop with the TkRat code

The TkRat library provides a number of commands to the tcl environment.
These commands are documented in doc/interface.

It is easy to use a debugger on TkRat, when you know the trick:-)
Personally I run gdb on the relevant wish-binary while standing in the
tkrat lib directory. In that directory I have a .gdbinit which contains:
set args ../tkrat/tkrat -confdir /home/maf/.test -appname tkrattest
This lets me have a completely separate tkrat directory for testing.
Unfortunately you can not just start 'gdb wish8.4' and then set
breakpoints inside the TkRat code. Since it is loaded dynamically you
must wait until it has been loaded. It gets loaded by the call to
'RatGetId' in start.tcl. One can add a small delay anyplace after that
to be able to break into teh debugger and set the desired breakpoints.
