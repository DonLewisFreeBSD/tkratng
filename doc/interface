provide.

	COMMANDS AND ENTITIES PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARY

    Folder entities

RatOpenFolder def
    Opens a folder. The argument should be the definition of the folder to
    open.

RatGetOpenHandler def
    Gets the folder handler of the folder if it is already open. Otherwise
    it returns an empty string.

$folder update mode
    Updates the mailbox. Mode can be either 'update', 'checkpoint' or
    'sync'. If it is 'update' then the function only check for new mail.
    If it is 'checkpoint' then it writes any unsaved flag-changes etc to disk
    and if it is 'sync' then the folder is expunged. Returns the number of
    new messages.

$folder close [force]
    Closes the folder. After this the folder handler is deleted. If the
    force argument is present and true then  the folder is closed no
    matter how many times it has been opened.

$folder setName name
    Sets the folder name to "name".

$folder info
    Returns a list with the following elements:
      Folder name (readable text string)
      Number of messages in folder (int)
      Size of folder (int)
    Some folder types may not support the size value. In this
    case -1 is returned.

$folder list format
    Returns a list with one entry per message in the folder The
    format of the entry is specified in the "format" argument.
    The "format" argument looks like a string to printf except
    the only thing that may follow the '%' (except another '%')
    is an optional integer (may be negative) and one of the
    following characters:
      s - Subject of message
      n - Name of sender or mailaddress if the name is not
	  available. If the sender matches myself then use
          'To: recpient' instead.
      N - Like 'n' but withot the special handling of myself.
      m - Mail address of sender
      r - Name of recipient
      R - Mail address of recipient
      b - Approximate size of message in bytes
      B - Approximate size of message in bytes (expressed as
	    a mangled number string)
      d - Message date (formatted)
      D - Message date (in seconds since the epoch)
      S - Message status (string of maximum 5 characters)
      i - Current message index in folder
      t - Threading string
      M - Message ID
      u - Message UID
      c - Canonalized subject
  In some cases the message size may not be available. In that
  case it is replaced by a '?'.

$folder get index
    Returns a message handler for the message specified
    by "index". This is an index into the list of messages
    as it is returned by the list command.

$folder setFlag {indexes} flag value
    Sets the specified flag of the messages specified by the list of indexes to
    a value (a boolean value). The flag is one of 'seen', 'deleted',
    'flagged' or 'answered'.

$folder getFlag index flag
    Gets the specified flag of the message specified by "index".
    The flag is one of 'seen', 'deleted','flagged' or 'answered'.

$folder flagged flag value
    Returns a list of messages (thir indexes) that have the given flag
    set to the given value. Flag can be one of 'seen', 'deleted','flagged'
    or 'answered'.

$folder insert message [message ...]
    Inserts the messages whose handlers are passed in the
    message arguments into the folder.

$folder type
    Returns the type of the folder (dbase, std or dis).

$folder find message
    Returns the index in the folder for the specified message, or -1 if
    the message is not associated with this folder.

$folder match expId
    Returns a list of indexes of messages that matches the given expression
    (you get the id from RatParseExp).

$folder getSortOrder
    Returns the current sort order of a folder

$folder setSortOrder order
    Sets a new sort order of a folder

$folder netsync
    Synchronizes the folder over the network if possible (only disconnected
    folders support this).

$folder refcount
    Returns how many current references there are to this folder.

$folder role
    Returns the role to use for this folder.

    Message entities

Each message has an associated variable named msgInfo_$message. When the
message is deleted this variable is unset.

$message headers
    Returns a list which contains all header lines from the message.
    Each element of the list is a list of two elements, the first is
    the header name and the second is the value.

$message body
    Returns the name of the bodypart entity contained in this message

$message rawText
    Returns the complete message as text.

$message get field...

    reply_to, to, cc and bcc.

$message reply to role
    Creates a new message handler which is fit to use for RatSend which
    is a reply to this message. The to field is either sender or all and
    denotes to whom the reply should go. There will be a member named
    data in the handler array which contains the body text of the reply.
    The new handler is returned.

$message copy vfolder_def
    Inserts a copy of the message in the vfolder defined by vfolder_def.

$message list format
    Returns information about the message. This command works like
    the folder list command but operates on only one message. See the
    documentation on folder list for description of the format argument.

$message pgp sign encrypt role signer enc_rcpts
    Do pgp operation on message. 'sign' and 'encrypt' are both booleans
    and inidcates which operation(s) to perform. 'role' is the role we are
    operating in. 'signer' is the use which should sign the message (ignores
    if 'sign' is false. 'enc_rcpts' is the recipients to which we should
    encrypt it (ignored if 'encrypt' is false. This modifies the message.

$message remove_internal
    Removes TkRat internal header fields from the message. This only has
    an effect on RatFrMessages.

$message duplicate
    Create a copy of this message

$message delete_attachments attachments dest_folder
    Delete the specified attachemnts and put the resulting message in
    the specified folder. Attachments are specified as a list of integers
    which give the "path" to the attachment.

    Bodypart entities

$body children

    a list of lists where each sublist contains two elements. The parameter
    name and its value.

$body parameter name
    Returns the value of the parameter specified by "name". If the
    parameter is unavailable an empty string is returned.

$body disp_type
    Returns the disposition type as set in the Content-Disposition
    header for this bodypart. If the bodypart does not have a
    Content-Disposition header the function returns an empty string.

    Returns the encoding the body is in.

$body isGoodCharset
    Returns true if this body is encoded in a charset we know how to handle.

$body data encoded charset
    Returns a string which contains the body content. If encoded is
    false any contet-transfer-encoding will be undone. The optional
    charset parameter tells which charset we should assume the body
    is encoded in, if no charset is given the body parameters are used.

$body saveData fileId encoded convertNL
    Saves the body data in the already opened file. The file must be
    opened for writing. If encoded is true the data is saved in the
    form it is in the mailbox. If encoded is false any transport
    encoding is undone. The convertNL argument controls if the lineends
    are converted to simple '\n'.

$body findShowCommand
    This checks if there is an entry in the mailcaps that matches this
    bodypart. The return value is a list. If there was no matching element
    then every entry in the list is empty. The list is {cmd term copious
    desc bitmap}. And the entries are:
	cmd	- The command to use to show this body (possibly with '%s')
	term	- A '1' if this program needs a terminal
	copious	- A '1' if this program gives lots of output

    returned.

$body encoded
    Returns 1 if the bodypart has been decoded. Zero otherwise.

$body sigstatus
    Gets the signature status for this bodypart. Possible return values
    are "pgp_none", "pgp_unchecked", "pgp_good" or "pgp_bad"

	TCL COMMANDS THE LIBRARY EXPECTS THE INTERFACE TO PROVIDE

RatLog level message duration
    Delivers a message from the library to the interface. The message is
    a string and level is a number with the following meaning:
	0 - babble messages from library, doesn't have to be shown
	1 - parse error, should probably be shown in some situations
	2 - informative message, should be displayed
	3 - warning messages, should be displayed
	4 - error, should be acknowledged by the user
	5 - fatal, the application is about to die
    The duration is an optional argument and can have a value of "time"
    or "explicit". If the value is explicit the a handle will be returned,
    and this handle can then be used in a call to RatClearLog

RatWantSave
    This command should ask the user if he wants to save an outgoing message.
    If the answer is no nothing is returned. If the answer is yes a the answer
    must look like one of these: {file <fname>} or {dbase <kwds> <extype>
    <exdate>}.

RatLogin host trial user prot port
    The host mentioned in the arguments requires an username and password
    for this user. The trial argument says how many tries we already have
    done. The user is the user we should try to log in as and prot is the
    protocol we are going to use. Finally port is the portnumber we will
    contact the remote host at. The routine should return a list of three
    elements {user passwd store} when store is a boolean indicating if we
    should store the password on disk or not.

RatDSNRecieve subject action recipient id
    A DSN has arrived for the mentioned message and recipient. Please notify
    the user.

UpdateDSN
    Gets called from the library when new DSN(s) arrive.

RatSendFailed name reason
    Called when TkRat fails to send a message. The "name" parameter contains a
    handler which identifies the message and "reason" is a text string
    describing what happened. This routine must take care of the passed
    message since it will otherwise be lost.

RatSaveOutgoing msg folder
    Try to save the give message to the given folder.
