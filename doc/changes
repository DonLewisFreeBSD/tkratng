010803: (feature) Cleaned up a lot of code. Converted all proces to

	the attachment list of the compose window.

	itself instead of directly mucking around with the file. This
	also means we can remove the ispell_dictionary option.

	since it was outdated.

010423:	(bug fix) Fixed problem where tkrat could hand while spell-

	(syntax checker) whithout generating any real warnings.

	both SMTP FROM and RCPT TO entries. Also fix the addresses
	shown to match reality.

001222:	(bug fix) It has turned out that the definition of the GB charsets
	in tcl is not the same as used in MIME-email. A quick workaround

	is statisfactory in the long run.

001216:	(bug fix) Could generate lines ened with bare newlines when sending
	attached messages.

001216:	(bug fix) Fixed handling of embedded '&' in urls when using other

001013:	(bug fix) The modifiers 'R' and 'r' in the folder list did the
	same "To:" transposing as 'n' and 'm', which it should not do.

001013:	(bug fix) The structure of folders could become corrupted after
	an import was done.

001010:	(feature) Removed browse button from mh-dialogs. MH-folders

000911:	(feature) Include version of lib in bug-reports.

000908:	(bug fix) Added focus command into ModalGrab so it is run before

	"Setup Network Sync" window so they reflect the actual order the
	items are performed. Thanks goes to "Stefan Richter

000822:	(bug fix) Passed to short buffer lengths to snprintf in ratDbase.c
	when checking dbase. Big thanks to "Peter TEX Weigand
	<aweigp@autelca.ascom.ch>" for finding this.

000819:	(bug fix) A number of minor tweaks in the reply-to line-wrapping
	algorithm.
	- if it should only wrap a single character then an extra newlin
	  was inserted.
	- Now does not join lines which starts with a non-alnum charcter
	  (ignoring LWSP).
	- Now does not break a line if there are no characters in the
	  part  about to be wrapped.
	
000817:	(bug fix) The Extract Addresses dialog did generate an error
	when you already had aliases for all addresses in the message.

000812:	(bug fix) Handle single quotes in mailcap files.

000805:	(bug fix) Changing some pgp-prefrences might not "take" until the
	next restart.

000805:	(bug fix) Changed behavious of file-selector. Now you can not write
	patterns on the filename line and have the ok/save button resolve
	them. The problem with this feature was that if the suggested filename
	contained any glob characters (* and ?) then the save button appeared
	not to work.

000805:	(bug fix) Editing the inbox could clear the "Save outgoing" marking
	of another folder.

000804:	(bug fix) It turned out that pgp-6.5.1i does not return a usable

	Also change action when verifying old type signatures, there
	seems to be no way of checking the return-values of the different
	pgp-versions and get reliable results. So I changed the sig button
	to always read "?" in those cases and you have to check the message
	yourself. Thanks goes to R Horn <rjh@world.std.com>.

000728:	(bug fix) Fixed bug where pgp signing generated a bad signature
	on all messages except the first message signed in a session. Also

	Truitt <wtruitt@usa.alcatel.com> for this patch.

000728:	(bug fix) One could not save outgoing messages to an open IMAP-
	folder without losing the connection. While fixing this bug I

	window. If it conatins multiple addresses they are now shown

	logic. Now silently ignores the looped entries instead of
	generating bad errors.

980823:	(feature) Changed behaviour of address entry fields. They now
	try to fit all addresses into one line. If that is not possible
	it tries to have two addresses per line. If any address is longer
	than half a line it uses only one address per line.

	the database did not see the last messages in the folder. The
	index information for these messages could get lost (but the
	messages are still in the database and willshow up as LostMessages
	when you check the database).

970627:	(bug fix) You got an error from the compose window if you had

	is included before the system directories.

970323:	(feature) There are now keyboard shortcuts for every menu.

970323:	(feature) Added option to include or not include signature of

970323:	(feature) Added linking of the build-in imap routine which supports
	autentification without sending passordws inb the clear.

970322:	(feature) Now checks that we have a valid hostname before we try
	to send any messages.

970322:	(bug fix) Now uses local hostname instead of ".MISSING.HOST.NAME"
	in addresses that are missing the domain part.

970322:	(bug fix) Plugged memeory leaks.

970321:	(feature) Redone the way the program is started. Now a /bin/sh-script
	gets installed in the bin directory. This script sets some environment
	variables before the actual program is started. This means that we
	no longer compile any paths into the tkrat program.

970321:	(feature) Added internal version of file command (gets used if we
	link with tcl < 8) which contains limited copy and delete functionality.

970320:	(feature) Added RatUP_Bell userproc.

970320:	(bug fix) The check database function now starts by checking if

970320:	(bug fix) The caching of passwords and conenctions didn't work
	under some conditions.

970320:	(bug fix) Now the buttons and menus change fontsize just as the rest
	of the widgets.

970316:	(bug fix) You could get the expression window to crash if you
	selected advanced mode while you still were in advanced mode. You
	could also cause tkrat to dump a core if you gave an empty expression.

970316:	(bug fix) The elm alias importion routine did not work.

970315:	(bug fix) Fixed bad trace deletion in compose.tcl

970313:	(bug fix) Fixed stupid bug in compose.tcl which made it crash when

970312: ***** released version 1.0 *****

970311:	(bug fix) Some of the dit operations in the compose window didn't
	check that we were in the rigth state (like having selected text
	before tanking it).

970311:	(bug fix) Fixed stupid bug which made it fail while autoloading
	AddImapPorts if you upgraded from version 0.74 to 1.0.

970310:	(bug fix) Made sure that lines in the database index never may
	contain an newline.

970310:	(bug fix) Made several fixes to encoding and decoding of header-
	lines.

970309:	(bug fix) The view DSN window (where one sees a full DSN) failed
	to show any extra information when the apropriate button was pressed.

970309:	(bug fix) Garbage could be shown at the end of some messages.

970308:	(bug fix) The blank line separating header and body could dissapear
	when you moved from dbase to dbase.

970306:	(bug fix) Improved configure script. Now looks for include files
	in more places and also checks for the 's' library (used on AIX).

970306:	(feature) Changed the texts of the buttons in the alias edit window.

970306:	(bug fix) TkRat failed to send messages if you had a hostname
	which included space.

970305:	(bug fix) You couldn't save outgoing messages to IMAP folders.

970305:	(bug fix) There was garbage added to the end of messages read
	from the database.

970305:	(bug fix) Remade the way unkown text messages and messages with
	unknown encodings are shown. The old behaviour didn't mix well with
	the text widget.

970305:	(bug fix) Found yet a couple of bugs in the date parsing code which
	made messages sort in the wrong order.

970304:	(bug fix) The internal copy of the mailcap got corrupted when it
	contained an test-clause which used parameters.

970304: (bug fix) The configure files didn't relly care about the
	--with-tk-config argument. Also added test for crypt library.

970304:	(bug fix) The import IMAP folders code required that a port number
	was specified.

970302:	(bug fix) Fixed multiple bugs in ComposeForwardInline and related
	functions. They didn't always find the rigth bodypart to inline.
	They could fail when you aborted in some cases and the also failed
	to clean up after themselves.

970302:	(feature) There is now a key to group messages (default 'g').

970302:	(bug fix) Improved code that read elm-aliases so that it now
	understands multi-line aliases. Thanks goes to Jonathan Cook
	<jcook@cs.nmsu.edu>.

970302:	(bug fix) Since you can not move messages to POP-folders then it is
	pretty meaningless to include thos folders in the Move menus.

970301:	(feature) The "See old messages" window did not export the selection.

970301:	(bug fix) "Subject by date" wasn't always correctly sorted.

970301:	(bug fix) Fixed bug which made it crash sometimes when moving between
	network folders and local folders.

970227:	(bug fix) Removed text about "Save outgoing" in the help window. It
	was an experimental feature that dissapeared many versions ago.

970226: ***** released version 0.75 *****

970225:	(bug fix) You can now have other characters than a-z in alias names.

970225:	(bug fix) Extract addresses didn't work very well on addresses
	that were MIME-encoded.

970224:	(bug fix) Close the login-window directly when done so that we
	do not accidentally lock the X-display if something bad happens.

970223:	(bug fix) If you did a reply to an message which contained an
	embedded message which contained further messages you didn't get
	to choose among them.

970223:	(upgrade) Upgraded to imap-4.1 toolkit (from 4.0).

970221:	(bug fix) The "Select the message before the first unread on open"
	mode should select the last message if there are no new messages.

970220:	(bug fix) The imap code could crash if it tried to read an message
	with an embedded message from an 4.1Rev1 server.

970220:	(bug fix) The AliasExtract function should not extract the full
	name into the alias content field.

970220: (bug fix) The address entry field (in the compose window) failed
	to calculate the correct with of an address when placing it in columns.
	It also always deleted trailing commas when the focus left it.

970220:	(bug fix) Increased SMTP timeout time to 120 seconds.

970218:	(bug fix) There were a couple of problems with the insert alias window
	(when composing messages). You couldn't scroll with the mouse and
	you couldn't insert any addresses after the first one.

970217:	(feature) You can now speficy the imap port number when importing
	imap folders.

970217:	(bug fix) A number of tests in ratDbase were too forgiving so the
	program could crash.

970214:	(bug fix) Probing for DSN support always reported yes if you
	had verbose mode on.

970213:	(bug fix) Disabled caching of pop-connections. They are not usable
	and it turns out that at least some pop servers only expunge messages
	when they receive a quit command (and this didn't always happen
	because we kept the link open).

970209:	(feature) Changed config-scripts to include tests for tcl(tk8.0.
	But I commented the tests out since I have since found problems
	with tcl/tk8.0a2.

970209:	(bug fix) Made sure that saved positions are within the visible area
	of the screen.

970209:	(bug fix) Text parts in unkown charsets were alwas shown in a
	12pt font.

970209:	(feature) Now defaults to specify the imap port. If this is not done
	then the imap toolkit tries to do an rsh to the remove host when
	opening an imap folder, first when this has failed did it try over
	the network.

970209:	(bug fix) Tkrat could dump if you tried to move a message to an
	imap folder.

970209: (feature) You can now autosave outgoing messages by marking one of
	your vfolders.

970208:	(bug fix) Now expands ~ in print command.

970208:	(bug fix) The alias extract window didn't care if you pressed ok or
	cancel. It added the aliases anyway, and it failed if all suggested
	aliases wree  deselected.

970206:	(bug fix) Changes to the watcher time interval only took effect when
	opening a new folder.

970205:	(bug fix) Do not move slection (of message) when doing a group move.

970205:	(bug fix) Stupid bug made the program crash if there were more than
	64 entries in the mailcap files.

970204:	(bug fix) The alias chooser window didn't change its view when the
	selection moved outside the current view.

970203:	(bug fix) You could get an error if you clicked on an empty subtopic
	in the help window and the Detach button shouldn't be enabled if you
	click in an empty attachment list in the compose window.

970203:	(bug fix) Remember the scrollbar position in the alias list when
	updating it.

970203:	(bug fix) You could get an error if you selected cancel when you
	were asked to choose message to forward/reply to.

970202: (feature) The prefereces window is now scrollable.

970202:	(bug fix) A stupid bug in the address splitting code sometimes
	dropped the final character from addresses.

970201:	(bug fix) TkRat only found a subset of the embedded messages when
	replying to a message which contains embedded messages. It also had
	problems if it found to many messages (the window grew to large).

970130:	(bug fix) The configure file didn't really check the --with-tk-config
	argument. Also now runs wish to get the lib directory that way (only
	if $DISPLAY is defined).

970129:	(bug fix) Importing aliases called the wrong function when it wanted
	to update eventual alias windows.

970128: ***** released version 0.74 *****

970128:	(bug fix) Made the configure script more robust. Also replaced
	the TCL_CONFIG_FILE and TK_CONFIG_FILE environment variables with
	real arguments to configure.

970127:	(bug fix) You could crash tkrat if you continued to try to define
	a file folder of dynamic folder after the first attempt failed.

	Thanks goes to P.H.A.Venemans@research.kpn.com.

970119:	(feature) The fileselector now sorts directories first.

970119:	(bug fix) TkRat didn't care if mail_ping reported that the stream was
	dead.

970119:	(bug fix) Sometimes TkRat crashed when done sending deferred messages.
	This was due to a bug in tcl.

970116:	(bug fix) Do not add the fullname to alias expansions if the alias
	in question doesn't have a fullname.

970113:	(bug fix) The code (undocumented) which were supposed to split
	the SMTP-hostname and an eventual portnumber didn't work.
	Thanks goes to Pieter H.A. Venemans <P.H.A.Venemans@research.kpn.com>

970110:	(feature) Added menu entries for folder sort order.

	they were tearoffed. Now they take the current message at the time
	of selection.

970109:	(feature) Moved some of the menu entries.

970108:	(bug fix) You could not import empty directories in the vfolderdef
	window.

	of them.

961215:	(bug fix) TkRat failed to monitor the inbox if this didn't exist
	when the program was started.
