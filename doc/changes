        again after having aborted the operation.

070129: (bug fix) Make sure that a message is selected after a filter
        is cleared. If no messages were selected then select the first

        by expression in a large folder (more than 1000 messages). The
        nasty thing about this bug was that the extra flagged messages did
        not show up as flagged unless one reopened the folder.

060412: (bug fix) TkRat could drop part of the address list when
        postponing a message.

        mimeprog (default file) to see if that generates mime-type
        output. Falls back to the old style if it is not supported.
        Also removed mimeprog from preferences GUI.

        get updated since the check got confused by teh address

040218: (bug fix) Ignore control characters and newlines when drawing
	list of messages.

040218: (feature) Did internal changes to the RatAlias commands. Address
	book entries can now specify which pgp key to use for the recipient.

040127: (feature) Removed ability to change how much aliases are expanded
	while in the compose window.

040115: (bug fix) Now closes all open instances of a folder if you
	change the definition of the underlying folder.

040113: (feature) Fixed so the grouping window does not forget the
	selection state when new emails arrive. This makes it much
	easier to quickly delete lots of email (i.e. spam).

040112: (bug fix) The periodic checking for new email closed any
	open balloon help text.

040105: (bug fix) Fixed core dump which could occur if you converted
	an open imap mailbox to a disconnected one and reopened it.

031217: (feature) Changed behavior of address (formerly alias) window.
	Also added support for pgp operations  and key per
	alias. However this is commented out until compose.tcl
	supports it.

031123: (feature) PGP signing is now controlled per role. Each role can
	select the default pgp signing status (on or off). It is also
	possible to specify which key the message should be signed with.

031119: (feature) Improved PGP key listing code. Now works much better when
	using GnuPG. You can now also select to list either secret or
	public keys.

031116: (bug fix) Be more tolerant towards bad folder definitions.

031113: (feature change) Moved the saving of outgoing messages to
	after they have been sent.

031106: (bug fix) Fixed encoding of line-endings when messages were
	encoded in quoted-printable.

031105: (feature) Removed the option watcher_name, now uses the localized
	string instead.

031105: (bug fix) Removed extra sender and reply-to headers when sending.

031103: (bug fix) Incorporated OpenBSD changes from Stuart Cassoff.

031103: (feature) Changed new folder wizard to autmatically figure out
	the mode (create, use or import).

030929: (feature) Added new german text from Thomas Fetcke.

030905: (bug fix) Escape more dangerous characters in URLs.

030813: (bug fix) Require at least version 2.0 of TkHtml. Also added
	note of this in the README-file.
	
030811: (bug fix) Removed the -verbose flag to pkg_mkIndex. This avoids a
	bug in tcl8.4 which prevented build.

030811: (feature) Changed flagging behavior so when flagging multiple
	messages all gets set to the same flag value as the first one.

030805: (feature) Reinstated old functionality. Shift-B2 now toggles the
	flagging for a range of messages.

030805: (feature) Changed from nanosleep() to usleep(). Should improve
	portability.

030701: (bug fix) Handle aspell (which behaves subtly different from ispell)

030624: (feature) Can now build with tcl/tk 8.5.

030624: (bug fix) Upgraded included c-client to version 2002d.

	operation failed when sending.

030611: (bug fix) Handle localized characters as well as () in subject
	when doing pretty-print.

030606: (feature) When importing, prune empty subfolders. This mainly
	effects Cyrus-users.

030605: (feature) Added "Clear selection" button to alias extract window.

030604: (feature) Do not open folders before appending a group of messages
	to it. This avoids one potentially expensive operation but assumes
	that IMAP connection caching keeps us from reconnecting for each
	message and that the underlying driver does not parse the entire
	mailbox for each append. Normally yhis is not a problem.

030604: (bug fix) Imap caching did not always work which affected
	IMAP performance negatively.

030528: (bug fix) Escape non us-ascii characters when pretty-printing.

030527: (feature) Improved speed of some group operations (flagging and
	deletion). This should be most visible when operating on a lot
	of messages in an IMAP-folder.

030523: (bug fix) Fixed problem where the database warned about inconsistent
	number of messages in database. it turned out that no messages
	were lost, but the error message was annoying.

030523: (bug fix) Changed the way parameters are encoded. Now there is an
	option which controls how to encode them (rfc2047, rfc2231 or both).
	Rfc2231 is the standard and rfc2047 is illegal. But some mailers
	(for example Outlook) does not understand rfc2231 but works ok with
	rfc2047. The default is both.

030516: (bug fix) Correctly handle both rfc2231 and rfc2047 encoded parameters.

030511: (feature) Added keyboard shortcut (Alt-d) for moving message to
	database.

030501: (feature) Subscribe to all created folders.

030428: (bug fix) The balloon help in the menus did show incorrect texts.

030428: (feature) Added context menu when pressing the third mousebutton
	over a message in the message-list.

030425: (feature) Writes/reads a file in the tmpdir once every day so that
	the directory is not removed by /tmp-cleaning programs.

030410: (feature) Applied speedup patch by Don Lewis.

030327: (bug fix) Repaired configure.in-file which the last update broke:-(
	Replaced --with-tclsh and --with-tcl-bin whith --with-tcl which
	covers both cases.

030325: (feature) Rewrote the busy-code to use facilities provided by modern
	versions of tcl/tk.

030321: (feature) Now looks for 8.4 by default (after tclsh). Also added
	support for 8.5.

030321: (feature) New configuration option --with-tclsh which forces
	TkRat to use the specified tclsh.

030321: (bug fix) Remove local copy of disconnected folder when deleting
	the folder.

030307: (bug fix) Handle dying of the sender a bit more gracefully.

030307: (bug fix) Reinstated header-line wrapping of outgoing emails.

030304: (feature) Added proxy support to the html handling. Code from
	Laurent Duperval.

030203: (feature) Added touched up xpm-version of logo provided by
	Robin Roe.

030203: (bug fix) Fixed problem where it was possible to drag a pane
	oustide the window thus making the display kind of confusing.

030128: (bug fix) Fixed problem where horizontal scrollbars appeared even
	though not really needed (Tk has some confusing definitions of
	width).

030121: (bug fix) Do not delete files when they are detached (unless they
	were created by Tkrat).

030114: (gui) Merged menus in New/edit folder window into one.

030113: (feature) Added wizard helping people to set thing up the first
	time they start TkRat.

021229: (bug fix) Converted preferences pane and vfolderdef pane to
	rat_scrollframe so scrollbars appears when needed.

021228: (bug fix) Fix so that messages in the preferences window adjust to
	the width of the window.

021228: (bug fix) Added patch from Marc Herbert which changed the
	SSL parameters to configure (making them saner).

021224: (feature) Implemented rfc2231 encoding of parameters.

021224: (feature) Changed c-client library to break lines when outputting
	parameters (if needed).

021221: (bug fix) Duplicated messages when moving multiple messages into
	a disconnected folder.

021220: (improvement) Improved the way PGP passphrases are cleared out
	of memory.

021219: (bug fix) The copy you may save of an outgoing message shoudl be
	marked as read.

021218: (feature) Upograded to imap-2002a toolkit.

021216: (bug fix) Fixed problem where inserting a message into an open
	db-folder crashed TkRat.

021211: (bug check) Added sanity check to disconnected folder sync.

021126: (bug fix) Fixed problem where the inbox might not be opened on start
	but rather another folder with the same name.
	
021029: (bug fix) Fixed problem with sending where a message could be sent
        twice and then you got an error message from mail_elt.

021001: (bug fix) Fixed subtle problem in configure which hit systems
	whith the openssl include-files installed but not the libraries.
	
020930: (feature) A small change with big impact. Changed the default font
	from bold to non-bold. Also shrunk the padding in all
	buttons. This gives IMHO a much sleeker look.

020925: (bug fix) Fixed pgp-test to work without a ~/.gnupg.

020925: (bug fix) Made sure every Tcl_DecrRefCount() in the code has a
	matching Tcl_IncrRefCount().

020925: (enhancement) Reset the balloon help timer not only on mouse motion
	events but also button and key events.

020924: (bug fix) Fixed problem when imap-folders does not exist.

020921: (nitfix) Lock interface while creating new folders.

020915: (bug fix) Had problems with pgp/mime messages.

020912: (bug fix) If you had an alias with the same key as a local user name
	then TkRat did show the local users full name in the address field.
	The message was however sent to the correct address.

020909: (bug fix) Update new-message count in database folders when reading
	messages. Unpdate new message count when marking messages as unread.

020909: (feature) Increased delay for balloon help (from .5s to 1.5s).
	This will hopefully make it less obnoxious.

020908: (bug fix) Fixed core-dump problem when compiled with wish8.4.
	There was a problem in the busy routines.

020906: (bug fix) Cleaned up file permissions. Now relies almost entirely
	on the umask. The only exception is the tmp-directory which is
	still created 0700. The permissions option became obsolete and
	is now removed.

020904: (bug fix) Replaced most occurrences for "regsub -all" and "SubstArg"
	with calls to "string map".

020902: (feature) Added support for SMTP authentication.

020830: (feature) Can now force all roles to use the same set of sending
	preferences.

020827: (feature) TkRat does now enable TLS (if compiled with encryption)

	disable the verification of the server certificate.

020826: (feature) Keep keyboard focus when adding new header entries in
	the compose window.

020825: (bug fix) URLs which contained '%u' could send tkrat into an
	eternal loop when pressed. Thanks goes to Marc Herbert.

020823: (feature) Removed baloon help from the message list and message body
	areas.

020822: (feature) Changed the way new features are presented. Now there
	will be a popup window whenever a new feature is added, not just
	when switching to a new release.

020821: (feature) Added support for Mozilla and Galeon as URL-viewers. Also
	added option which controls if URLs should be opened in new windows
	etc.

020819: (feature) Changed folder update code so now all folders are updated
	at once, this should reduce the flickering some p}eople see. The 
	new code also immediately sees when the watcher interval is changed.

020819: (feature) Added buttons to increase/decrease the size of all fonts
	in the preferences window.

020819: (feature) Changed default keyboard bindings to inlude "Pg down",

020719: (feature) Upgraded to autoconf 2.50. Now tkrat/tkrat and test/run
	will be executable also after calling config.status.

020719: (feature) The first big step for the version after 2.1
	* Rewrote message holding to use a normal folder
	  To continue composing you now doubleclock on a message in this
	  folder. This mechanism needs to be improved.
	* Rewrote message sending, this lead to:
	  - The outgoing queue is now a normal folder
	  - PGP operations now happens immediately when send is pressed
	  - Save to operations are also performed when send is pressed
	  - it will be easy to support smtp authentication
	* The old hold mechanism is now obsolete
	* Moved obsolete library calls to a new library 'ratlib' which is
	  dynamically loaded when needed
	* Set option to c-client to avoid status-message in local
	  file-folders

	any of the address fields.

020101: (bug fix) Restored the address checking stuff which marks

	in abnormal situations.

011127: ***** Made snapshot 20011127 *****

011127: (feature) Now asks for confirmation before quitting (when closing

011124: (feature) You can now specify which PGP key to use for signing
	for each role.

011124: (behaviour) Implemented a common function which generates the

	gets disabled when illegal etc. It is now also more error resistant.

011121: (bug fix) Finally did a complete fix of the drag&drop problems
	in the New/Edit folder window.

011117: (bug fix) Enabling monitoring of a folder did not update the
	vfolderdef window. And it did not take effect until after
	reboot.

011117: (bug fix) Fix to mime.tcl so we have file-commands which are
	stupid and prints stuff on stderr.

011116: (bug fix) Instead of using the actual host and user-names use the
	values specified in the role.

011110: (bug fix) The new message counter counted delivery notifications
	double.

011026: (bug fix) Toggling the visibility of embedded text-parts could
	affect the visibility of all following parts as well.

011017: (feature) Now remembers text properties (wrapping etc.) when

	it shouldn't move the view unless acceptable.

010906: (feature) Now handles buggy MTAs which encode PGP-messages.

	obsoleted by the online/offline mode stuff and actually now
	only served to confuse people.

010812: (feature) Added support for roles. The role determines which address
	to use, which signature-file to use and how to send
	messages. One can switch roles manually and also have
	different default-roles for different folders.

010808: (feature) Radically changed layout of preferences window. This
	was done to partly make it easier to use and partially to prepare
	for the roles feature.

010808: (feature) Improved layout of tree widget by making it denser. It
	now also only adds the scrollbars when needed.

010803: (feature) Cleaned up a lot of code. Converted all proces to
	use the Tcl_Obj iterfaces and also converted lots of other
	things to Tcl_Obj. This should make tkrat marginally faster

	the attachment list of the compose window.

010730:	(feature) Added icon indicating online/offline status.

	checker now does a replace as well.

010502:	(feature) Spell-checking: Changed learn feature to use ispell
	itself instead of directly mucking around with the file. This
	also means we can remove the ispell_dictionary option.

010430:	(bug fix) Removed text listing which languages are implemented
	since it was outdated.

010423:	(bug fix) Fixed problem where tkrat could hand while spell-
	checking a message.

	(syntax checker) whithout generating any real warnings.

010410:	(feature) Improved the show generated headers function to show
	both SMTP FROM and RCPT TO entries. Also fix the addresses
	shown to match reality.

010324:	(bug fix) Fixed potential core-dump in pgp code.

010324:	(bug fix) Rewrote word finding algorithm in rat_ispell.tcl to

010302:	(bug fix) Fixed references to option(simple_data) which were
	misspelled.

001227:	(feature) Added framework for automated testing. Also implemented
	tests for online/offline mode.

001227:	(feature) Implemented online/offline mode. This only affects
	 disconnected folders and message sending.

001225:	(feature) Added code to control the ssh-preferences in c-client.
	This means that one can now set it up to use SSH to contact imap
	and pop severs.

001223:	(feature) Be more forgiving when using strange charsets while
	composing.

010220: ***** released version 2.0.1 *****

010212:	(bug fix) Did not include all heades when forwarding a message
	as attachment.

010212:	(bug fix) Fixed ballon help in compose window. Thanks goes to
	Thomas Fetcke.

010212:	(feature) Added german language texts. Thanks goes to Daniel
	Egger <egger@suse.de>, Jochen Bern <bern@TI.Uni-Trier.DE>, and
	Thomas Fetcke <Thomas.Fetcke@t-online.de>.

010126:	(bug fix) The watcher did not always trig on new messages. Thanks
	goes to rgm@cadence.com who spotted the exact problem.

010112:	(bug fix) The local copies of imported disconnected folders did
	not get created automatically and therefore never filled up.

010112:	(bug fix) Importing disconnected folder did not give usable folders.

010112:	(bug fix) Importing folders did not work at all under some
	circumstances.

001228:	(feature) Added code which checks the vfolderdef file version
	and aborts if it is too high.

001226:	(bug fix) Fixed potential header corruption internally.

001222:	(bug fix) It has turned out that the definition of the GB charsets
	in tcl is not the same as used in MIME-email. A quick workaround
	is to treat them as us-ascii instead. This is not a solution which
	is statisfactory in the long run.

001216:	(bug fix) Could generate lines ened with bare newlines when sending
	attached messages.

001216:	(bug fix) Fixed handling of embedded '&' in urls when using other
	browsers than netscape.

001204: ***** released version 2.0 *****

	presses the dismiss-button.

001017:	(feature) Added charset aliases for a number of windows-fonts
	so tkrat should now understand most windows codepages. Also made
	tkrat try the encoding-name directly to see if tcl supports it.

001013:	(bug fix) The modifiers 'R' and 'r' in the folder list did the
	same "To:" transposing as 'n' and 'm', which it should not do.

001013:	(bug fix) The structure of folders could become corrupted after
	an import was done.

001010:	(feature) Removed browse button from mh-dialogs. MH-folders
	are always specified relative the users mh-path and not from
	the root as the file-browser did.

001009:	(bug fix) Do not generate invalid vfolderlist-file when the
	user deletes all folders.

000921:	(bug fix) Check database could wrongly accuse the index.info to
	contain the wrong number of messages.

000920:	(bug fix) Encrypting and signing with pgp 5 did not work.

000917:	(bug fix) Saving outgoing messages did not always reuse the 
	open connection to an mailbox and thus resulted in delays before
	the new messge was seen in the folder.

000915:	(bug fix) Fixed handling of line-endings when saving messages.
	This bug could lead to errors (message contains bare newlines)
	when saving mail to picky imap-servers.

000911:	(feature) Include version of lib in bug-reports.

000908:	(bug fix) Added focus command into ModalGrab so it is run before
	the grab. This should help with some window managers.

000908:	(bug fix) Allow exlamation marks inside URLs.

000906:	(bug fix) Certain edit-operations in the header fields of the

000822:	(bug fix) Finally fixed the extract addresses function for messages
	with lots fo addresses.

000822:	(feature) Also set the name parameter on the content-type for
	attachments. Thanks goes to "Stefan Richter
	<richtest@bauwesen.tu-cottbus.de>"

000822:	(clarified) Rearranged the order of the entries in the
	"Setup Network Sync" window so they reflect the actual order the
	items are performed. Thanks goes to "Stefan Richter

000822:	(bug fix) Passed to short buffer lengths to snprintf in ratDbase.c
	when checking dbase. Big thanks to "Peter TEX Weigand
	<aweigp@autelca.ascom.ch>" for finding this.

000819:	(bug fix) A number of minor tweaks in the reply-to line-wrapping
	algorithm.
	- if it should only wrap a single character then an extra newlin
	  was inserted.
	- Now does not join lines which starts with a non-alnum charcter
	  (ignoring LWSP).
	- Now does not break a line if there are no characters in the
	  part  about to be wrapped.
	
000817:	(bug fix) The Extract Addresses dialog did generate an error
	when you already had aliases for all addresses in the message.

000812:	(bug fix) Handle single quotes in mailcap files.

000812:	(bug fix) Handle delete requests from wm for list windows. This

000806:	(bug fix) Removed wrapping of unencoded header-lines.

000805:	(bug fix) The listing of pgp-keys on the keyring was riddled

000805:	(bug fix) Changing some pgp-prefrences might not "take" until the
	next restart.

000805:	(bug fix) Changed behavious of file-selector. Now you can not write
	patterns on the filename line and have the ok/save button resolve
	them. The problem with this feature was that if the suggested filename
	contained any glob characters (* and ?) then the save button appeared
	not to work.

000805:	(bug fix) Editing the inbox could clear the "Save outgoing" marking
	of another folder.

000804:	(bug fix) It turned out that pgp-6.5.1i does not return a usable
	exit-code when checking signatures. Therefore I changed the code
	to always show the questionmark for that one so as to force the
	user to press the pgp-button and read the output.

000729:	(bug fix) Fixed watcher to not beep when a message arrives in
	a monitored but not watched folder.

000728:	(bug fix) Fixed alias extract window to add a scrollbar when it
	needs to fit on the screen.

000728:	(bug fix) Moving messages between open folders now work much
	better.

000728:	(bug fix) Removed extraneous newline inserted when moving messages.
	This newline also caused problems with some picky IMAP-servers.

000728:	(bug fix) Better arguments to gpg when checking signatures.
	Also change action when verifying old type signatures, there
	seems to be no way of checking the return-values of the different
	pgp-versions and get reliable results. So I changed the sig button
	to always read "?" in those cases and you have to check the message
	yourself. Thanks goes to R Horn <rjh@world.std.com>.

000728:	(bug fix) Fixed bug where pgp signing generated a bad signature
	on all messages except the first message signed in a session. Also
	added support for the sha1 algorithm. Big thanks goes to Walter
	Truitt <wtruitt@usa.alcatel.com> for this patch.

000728:	(bug fix) One could not save outgoing messages to an open IMAP-
	folder without losing the connection. While fixing this bug I
	uncovered a number of other problems relating to the watcher
	and other things which also were fixed.

000714:	(bug fix) Fixed serious bug in insert function which could
	cause core-dumps. Big thanks to "Derek B. Noonburg"
	<derekn@foolabs.com> who submitted a patch.

	Nic Bernstein <nic@postilion.org>.

000711:	(change) Changed the default folder location from being $MAIL to
	being the default compiled into c-client. This only applies to
	people who start tkrat for the first time at sites which haven't
	overridden the default start folder in some global ratatoskrc folder.

000710:	(bug fix) Allow people to upgrade attachments encoding from 8bit
	to binary.

000710:	(bug fix) Always treat non-text attachments as binary to avoid
	problems with lineending conversions.

000708:	(bug fix) Group expression could appear twice in the list.

000708:	(feature) Added check of tcl-version to avoid bug reports from
	people who run it with tcl/tk < 8.1.

000708:	(bug fix) Garbage got added to the end of the message when sending.

000703: (bug fix) BackSpace delete characters to the right of the cursor
	when positioned at the top left corner.

	people who are replying above the quoted text.

000629:	(bug fix) Folder list could get out of sync on folders which
	were not monitored when new messages arrived.

000628:	(bug fix) Replaced unportable snprintf define with my own
	function (only used if snprintf is not already available.
	Thanks goes to Lloyd.Parkes@vuw.ac.nz for the tip.

	was selected in the alias-list.

000627: (bug fix) Changed order show and group menus were created to fix
	keyboard navigation.

	at the same time as an imap login window.

000610:	(feature) Can now change keyboard shortcut for compose_key_copy.

000610:	(bug fix) Could get tcl error when closing a window for some
	window managers. Added sanity checks.

000607:	(feature) Changed the order things are done when synchronizing
	with the network. The new order is to start by running an external
	program, then send deferred and finally send deferred.

000607:	(bug fix) Fixed problems with triggered when one turned off
	monitoring of an open folder.

	logic. Now silently ignores the looped entries instead of
	generating bad errors.

980823:	(feature) Changed behaviour of address entry fields. They now
	try to fit all addresses into one line. If that is not possible
	it tries to have two addresses per line. If any address is longer
	than half a line it uses only one address per line.

	balloon help behaviour somewhat. Now it only pops up once in a
	widget until you reenter it again.

	even if you had pgp support turned off. This is now fixed.

970824:	(feature) It is now impossible to change the color scheme
	if your tk is older than 8.0. These versions had a bug which
	made this not work anyway. You get a warning instead.

	the list of messages. Had to convert the list of messages to a text
	widget to be able to acomplish this.

970823:	(feature) The URL parsding is now done on demand instead of all
	at once. Also made a small modification to the search expression.

	button to make it easier to report tcl bugs.

970803:	(feature) Rewrote the alis window from scratch. Many enhancements
	to the alias system in general as well.

970719:	(bug fix) The menu shortcuts <Alt-?> should no longer also invoke
	any other bindings.

970706:	(feature) TkRat now send multiple messages through one SMTP-channel
	when sending deferred. The send deferred window now behaves better
	when you send more messages while already sending.

970706:	(bug fix) TkRat now survies if $HOME ends with a /.

970706:	(bug fix) TkRat is now more resistent to bad images in attachments.

	contained messages.

970628:	(bug fix) Fixed dependecies in lib/Makefile.in.

970627:	(bug fix) Fixed a stupid bug in the database code. Sometimes
	the database did not see the last messages in the folder. The
	index information for these messages could get lost (but the
	messages are still in the database and willshow up as LostMessages
	when you check the database).

970627:	(bug fix) You got an error from the compose window if you had
	deleted the default save folder.

970627:	(bug fix) Garbage was attached to message when they were saved
	to IMAP folders while sending.

970625:	(bug fix) The SendBugReport menu entry did now work.

970625: (bug fix) The sync command did not work!

970624: (bug fix) Some dates in the changes files were wrong.

970624:	(bug fix) Under some circumstances could tkrat and the imap toolkit
	get out of sync and you got the message "bad msgno".

970623:	(bug fix) Recoded RatMangleNumber in C since tcl8 has new number
	representations the breaks the tcl version.

970623:	(bug fix) Importing IMAP folder could give strange results when
	the first folder in a subtree was selectable.

970622:	(bug fix) Attached PGP keys are now sent as multipart with only
	one key per part.

	with the message "Message contains bare newlines".

970620:	(bug fix) The define keys window did not behave well when resized.

970620:	(bug fix) Message list scrolling did not always work correctly under
	tcl/tk 8.0.

970620:	(feature) URL now flash when ypu press them.

970620:	(feature) The color of URLs is now an option.

970620:	(bug fix) TkRat got into an incosistent internal state if you did not

970616:	(bug fix) Keyboard shortcuts in menus could be indicated wrongly
	if they containd a Shift-.

	changes are on top. Thanks goes to Matt Shibla <mshibla@mbhs.edu>
	who did the reordering.

970611:	(bug fix) Changed order of compilation flags so the c-client directory
	is included before the system directories.

970610:	(bug fix) Scan for PGP messages continued long after the current
	message so this test returned to many trues (which gave strange
	results). Also tried to display PGP output even if the user aborted
	the operation and thus no output was generated.

970607: ***** released version 1.0.1 *****

970607:	(feature) Added support for the frink tcl minimizer.

970529:	(bug fix) Made minor fixes to the helptexts.

970529:	(bug fix) Moved the color initialization to after the font

	the default tk fonts available.

970529:	(feature) Changed default interactive command to 'xterm -e sh -c'

970519:	(bug fix) The address entry windows assumed they were always 73

970325:	(bug fix) Fixed reading uniniztialized memory in RatType.

970323:	(feature) There are now keyboard shortcuts for every menu.

970323:	(feature) Added option to include or not include signature of
	letters we are replying to in the reply.

970323:	(feature) Added linking of the build-in imap routine which supports
	autentification without sending passordws inb the clear.

970322:	(feature) Now checks that we have a valid hostname before we try
	to send any messages.

970322:	(bug fix) Now uses local hostname instead of ".MISSING.HOST.NAME"
	in addresses that are missing the domain part.

970322:	(bug fix) Plugged memeory leaks.

970321:	(feature) Redone the way the program is started. Now a /bin/sh-script
	gets installed in the bin directory. This script sets some environment
	variables before the actual program is started. This means that we
	no longer compile any paths into the tkrat program.

970321:	(feature) Added internal version of file command (gets used if we
	link with tcl < 8) which contains limited copy and delete functionality.

970320:	(feature) Added RatUP_Bell userproc.

	of the widgets.

970316:	(bug fix) You could get the expression window to crash if you
	selected advanced mode while you still were in advanced mode. You
	could also cause tkrat to dump a core if you gave an empty expression.

970316:	(bug fix) The elm alias importion routine did not work.

970315:	(bug fix) Fixed bad trace deletion in compose.tcl

970313:	(bug fix) Fixed stupid bug in compose.tcl which made it crash when
	you tried to use the alias list (thanks to eubell@itwm.uni-kl.de).

970312: ***** released version 1.0 *****

970311:	(bug fix) Some of the dit operations in the compose window didn't
	check that we were in the rigth state (like having selected text
	before tanking it).

970311:	(bug fix) Fixed stupid bug which made it fail while autoloading
	AddImapPorts if you upgraded from version 0.74 to 1.0.

970310:	(bug fix) Made sure that lines in the database index never may
	contain an newline.

970310:	(bug fix) Made several fixes to encoding and decoding of header-
	lines.

	in more places and also checks for the 's' library (used on AIX).

970306:	(feature) Changed the texts of the buttons in the alias edit window.

970306:	(bug fix) TkRat failed to send messages if you had a hostname
	which included space.

970305:	(bug fix) You couldn't save outgoing messages to IMAP folders.

970305:	(bug fix) There was garbage added to the end of messages read
	from the database.

970305:	(bug fix) Remade the way unkown text messages and messages with
	unknown encodings are shown. The old behaviour didn't mix well with
	the text widget.

970305:	(bug fix) Found yet a couple of bugs in the date parsing code which
	made messages sort in the wrong order.

970304:	(bug fix) The internal copy of the mailcap got corrupted when it
	contained an test-clause which used parameters.

970304: (bug fix) The configure files didn't relly care about the
	--with-tk-config argument. Also added test for crypt library.

970304:	(bug fix) The import IMAP folders code required that a port number
	was specified.

970302:	(bug fix) Fixed multiple bugs in ComposeForwardInline and related
	functions. They didn't always find the rigth bodypart to inline.
	They could fail when you aborted in some cases and the also failed
	to clean up after themselves.

970302:	(feature) There is now a key to group messages (default 'g').

970302:	(bug fix) Improved code that read elm-aliases so that it now
	understands multi-line aliases. Thanks goes to Jonathan Cook
	<jcook@cs.nmsu.edu>.

970302:	(bug fix) Since you can not move messages to POP-folders then it is
	pretty meaningless to include thos folders in the Move menus.

970301:	(feature) The "See old messages" window did not export the selection.

970301:	(bug fix) "Subject by date" wasn't always correctly sorted.

970301:	(bug fix) Fixed bug which made it crash sometimes when moving between
	network folders and local folders.

970227:	(bug fix) Removed text about "Save outgoing" in the help window. It
	was an experimental feature that dissapeared many versions ago.

970226: ***** released version 0.75 *****

970225:	(bug fix) You can now have other characters than a-z in alias names.

970225:	(bug fix) Extract addresses didn't work very well on addresses
	that were MIME-encoded.

970224:	(bug fix) Close the login-window directly when done so that we
	do not accidentally lock the X-display if something bad happens.

970223:	(bug fix) If you did a reply to an message which contained an
	embedded message which contained further messages you didn't get
	to choose among them.

970223:	(upgrade) Upgraded to imap-4.1 toolkit (from 4.0).

970221:	(bug fix) The "Select the message before the first unread on open"
	mode should select the last message if there are no new messages.

970220:	(bug fix) The imap code could crash if it tried to read an message
	with an embedded message from an 4.1Rev1 server.

	name into the alias content field.

970220: (bug fix) The address entry field (in the compose window) failed
	to calculate the correct with of an address when placing it in columns.
	It also always deleted trailing commas when the focus left it.

970220:	(bug fix) Increased SMTP timeout time to 120 seconds.

970218:	(bug fix) There were a couple of problems with the insert alias window
	(when composing messages). You couldn't scroll with the mouse and
	you couldn't insert any addresses after the first one.

970217:	(feature) You can now speficy the imap port number when importing
	imap folders.

970217:	(bug fix) A number of tests in ratDbase were too forgiving so the
	program could crash.

970214:	(bug fix) Probing for DSN support always reported yes if you
	had verbose mode on.

970213:	(bug fix) Disabled caching of pop-connections. They are not usable
	and it turns out that at least some pop servers only expunge messages
	when they receive a quit command (and this didn't always happen
	because we kept the link open).

970209:	(feature) Changed config-scripts to include tests for tcl(tk8.0.
	But I commented the tests out since I have since found problems
	with tcl/tk8.0a2.

970209:	(bug fix) Made sure that saved positions are within the visible area
	of the screen.

970209:	(bug fix) Text parts in unkown charsets were alwas shown in a
	12pt font.

970209:	(feature) Now defaults to specify the imap port. If this is not done
	then the imap toolkit tries to do an rsh to the remove host when
	opening an imap folder, first when this has failed did it try over
	the network.

970209:	(bug fix) Tkrat could dump if you tried to move a message to an
	imap folder.

970209: (feature) You can now autosave outgoing messages by marking one of
	your vfolders.

970208:	(bug fix) Now expands ~ in print command.

970208:	(bug fix) The alias extract window didn't care if you pressed ok or
	cancel. It added the aliases anyway, and it failed if all suggested
	aliases wree  deselected.

970206:	(bug fix) Changes to the watcher time interval only took effect when
	opening a new folder.

970205:	(bug fix) Do not move slection (of message) when doing a group move.

970205:	(bug fix) Stupid bug made the program crash if there were more than
	64 entries in the mailcap files.

970204:	(bug fix) The alias chooser window didn't change its view when the
	selection moved outside the current view.

970203:	(bug fix) You could get an error if you clicked on an empty subtopic
	in the help window and the Detach button shouldn't be enabled if you
	click in an empty attachment list in the compose window.

970203:	(bug fix) Remember the scrollbar position in the alias list when
	updating it.

970203:	(bug fix) You could get an error if you selected cancel when you
	were asked to choose message to forward/reply to.

970202: (feature) The prefereces window is now scrollable.

970202:	(bug fix) A stupid bug in the address splitting code sometimes
	dropped the final character from addresses.

970201:	(bug fix) TkRat only found a subset of the embedded messages when
	replying to a message which contains embedded messages. It also had
	problems if it found to many messages (the window grew to large).

970130:	(bug fix) The configure file didn't really check the --with-tk-config
	argument. Also now runs wish to get the lib directory that way (only
	if $DISPLAY is defined).

970129:	(bug fix) Importing aliases called the wrong function when it wanted
	to update eventual alias windows.

970128: ***** released version 0.74 *****

970128:	(bug fix) Made the configure script more robust. Also replaced
	the TCL_CONFIG_FILE and TK_CONFIG_FILE environment variables with
	real arguments to configure.

970127:	(bug fix) You could crash tkrat if you continued to try to define
	a file folder of dynamic folder after the first attempt failed.

	Thanks goes to P.H.A.Venemans@research.kpn.com.

970119:	(feature) The fileselector now sorts directories first.

970119:	(bug fix) TkRat didn't care if mail_ping reported that the stream was
	dead.

970119:	(bug fix) Sometimes TkRat crashed when done sending deferred messages.
	This was due to a bug in tcl.

970116:	(bug fix) Do not add the fullname to alias expansions if the alias
	in question doesn't have a fullname.

970113:	(bug fix) The code (undocumented) which were supposed to split
	the SMTP-hostname and an eventual portnumber didn't work.
	Thanks goes to Pieter H.A. Venemans <P.H.A.Venemans@research.kpn.com>

970108:	(bug fix) You could not import empty directories in the vfolderdef
	window.

961228:	(bug fix) Fixed some memory leaks.

961228:	(bug fix) Sometimes one submenu in the vfolderlist could obtain an
	inbox mark.

	when saving bodyparts.

	name which contained whitespace.

	did enhancements to the alias window(s), now updates show in all
	of them.

961215:	(bug fix) TkRat failed to monitor the inbox if this didn't exist
	when the program was started.

961214:	(bug fix) The folder menu didn't work if you had an dynamic folder

	level content-type was text/plain or multipart/mixed.

961214:	(bug fix) Sometimes an extra "Status: RO" was added to the last
	header row of messages.

961214:	(bug fix) Tell the user that he must restart for a change to
	masquerade_as to take effect.

961103: ***** released version 0.73 *****

961102:	(feature) The Makefiles now support the --program-prefix and
	--program-suffix configure arguments.
