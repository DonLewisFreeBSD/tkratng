.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mailutil
replaces the old chkmail, imapcopy, imapmove, imapxfer, mbxcopy,
mbxcreat, and mbxcvt programs.
.PP
.B mailutil check
determines whether new mail exists in the given mailbox (the default
is INBOX).  The number of new messages is defined as the number of
messages that have "Recent" status set.  If the mailbox contains no
new messages, 
.B mailutil check
will indicate that no new mail is present;
otherwise, it will report the number of new messages.  In either case,
it will also indicate the canonical form of the name of the mailbox.
.PP
.B mailutil create
creates a new
.I mailbox
with the given name.  The mailbox name must not already exist.  A mailbox
can be created in a particular format by prefixing the name with 
.I #driver.
followed by the format name and a
.I /
character.  For example, the command
.br
   mailutil create #driver.mbx/junkmail
.br
will create a new mailbox named "junkmail" in mbx format.
.PP
.B mailutil delete
deletes an existing
.I mailbox
with the given name.
.PP
.B mailutil rename
renames an existing mailbox to a new name (which must not already exist).
This only works if the old and new names are in the same mail store.  A
more general means to rename a mailbox is to do a
.B mailutil copy
of the old name to the new name, followed by a
.B mailutil delete
of the old name.
.PP
.B mailutil copy
creates a new mailbox and copies messages from the old mailbox to the
new mailbox.  As in
.B mailutil create
a mailbox format can be specified with the new mailbox.  For example, the
command
.br
   mailutil copy INBOX #driver.mbx/INBOX
.br
will copy messages from your existing INBOX to an mbx-format INBOX.
.PP
.B mailutil move
is similar to
.B mailutil copy
but in addition will also remove (delete and expunge) the messages from the
old mailbox after copying them to the new mailbox.
.PP
.B mailutil append
and
.B mailutil appenddelete
are similar to
.B mailutil copy
and
.B mailutil move
respecitively except that they do not create the destination mailbox.
.PP
.B mailutil prune
prunes the mailbox of messages which match certain criteria, which are
in the form of IMAP2 (RFC 1176) SEARCH arguments.  For example, the
command.
.br
  mailutil prune INBOX "before 1-jan-2004"
.br
will delete and expunge all messages written before January 1, 2004.
.PP
.B mailutil transfer
copies an entire hierarchy of mailboxes from the named source to the
named destination.  Mailboxes are created on the destination as
needed.  Any error in copying messages will cause the transfer to stop.
.PP
Normally, any error in creation will cause the transfer to stop.
However, if
.B -merge mode 
is specified, a merging transfer is performed.  The
.B mode
argument the type of merge.
.PP
.B -merge prompt
indicates that the user should be asked for an alternative name to create.
If creating the new name fails, the user will be asked again.
.PP
.B -merge append
indicates that it's alright to copy the messages into an existing mailbox
with that name.  If the mailbox does not exist, the user will be prompted
for an alternative name.
.PP
.B -merge suffix=XXXX
where XXXX is any string, indicates that an alternative name should be
built by appending the given suffix to the name.  It that alternative name
can't be created, then the user will be prompted for an alternative name.
.PP
The source hierarchy consists of all mailboxes which start
with the given source name.  With the exception of a remote system
specification (within "{}" braces), the source name is used as the
name of the destination.  The destination hierarchy is a prefix
applied to any new names being created.  For example,
.br
   mailutil transfer foo bar
.br
will copy all mailboxes with names beginning with "foo" to names
beginning with "bar" (hence "foobar" will be copied to "barfoobar").
Similarly,
.br
   mailutil transfer "{imap.foo.com}" "{imap.bar.com}old/"
.br
will copy all mailboxes from the imap.foo.com IMAP server to
equivalent names starting with "old/" on the imap.bar.com IMAP server.
.SH FLAGS
The
.B -debug
flag prints full debugging telemetry including protocol operations.
.PP
The
.B -verbose
flag prints verbose (non-error) telemetry.
.PP
The
.B -rwcopy
flag causes the source mailbox to be open in readwrite mode rather than
readonly mode.  Normally, mailutil tries to use readonly mode to avoid
altering any flags in the source mailbox, but some mailbox types, e.g.
POP3, can't be open in readonly mode.
.SH ARGUMENTS

variety of mailbox name formats and types of mailboxes are supported
