		README file for the text system

The dotext.tcl program builds the text files used by TkRat from the
source files (suffixes .text and .help) located in this directory.
When run without arguments ('tclsh dotext.tcl') it will print warnings
about missing messages. Thus one can for example do
	tclsh dotext.tcl | grep Svenska
to see if there are any messages in Swedish missing. During the normal
build process, this output is suppressed.

    TO ADD A NEW LANGUAGE

The only thing that has to be done to add a new language is to modify
the "languages" list in defs.tcl. This will work since all messages that
are not provided in the new language will fall back to the English version. :-)
It is, however, appreciated if the person adding a new language also produces
texts for that language.

The syntax of the source files should be obvious (but is documented below
anyway). You can use dotext.tcl ('tclsh dotext.tcl') to check if you
have provided all needed texts for a new language. dotext.tcl will warn
about any missing definitions.


    FORMAT OF THE SOURCE FILES

The texts of TkRat are divided among four variables: t, changes, balloon and
help. There is a one-to-one correlation between source files in this directory
and variables. Messages for each language must be written in the character set
specified in dotext.tcl for that language. That means that multiple character
sets are used simultaneously in the source files.
Each source file starts with a variable statement:

	variable <var>

Where <var> is the name of the variable that the content of this file should
go into. After that, the .text files consist of a lot of labels and their
definitions. Each looks like:

	label <lab>
	<l1> <Message in language 1 (and in charset 1)>
	<l2> <Message in language 2 (and in charset 2)>

Where <lab> is the label name (must be lower case and unique) and <l1> and
<l2> are shorthand names for languages as defined in the "languages" list
in dotext.tcl.


The files are read via the tcl 'source' command. That means that they will
follow the usual tcl quotation rules, etc. That is:

    * A message that contains embedded spaces bust be enclosed in quotes ("")
      or braces ({}). Example: "Tkrat 0.64"
    * A message which contains newlines must be enclosed by braces ({}).

It is always a good idea to look how the files are written before adding
anything new.


    FORMAT OF THE GENERATED FILES

The output is generated in the directory specified by the outdir variable
in dotext.tcl. First, a file 'languages.tcl' is created and in this file a
procedure GetLanguages is defined. This procedure returns a list of the
available languages. This file also defines the InitMessages proc, which
should be called to initialize a set of messages (arguments are variable
and language).

The actual messages are stored in files named text_<var>_<language>.tcl
where <var> is the variable and <language> is the language of the
messages in the file. Each such file contains one proc which is named
"init_VAR_LANGUAGE" (VAR and LANGUAGE are substituted with the appropriate
values), this is used by the auto-loading mechanism.

This command builds the text files from the data files found in this
directory. As input, it uses all files in the directory which end in
".text". These files should be in the following format:

variable <var>

label <lab>
<l1> <Message in language 1>
<l2> <Message in language 2>
[etc...]

label <lab2>
[etc...]

Where <var> is the name of the variable which is to hold these messages,
<lab> is the label of a message, <l1> and <l2> are language shorthand
names as specified below.
